# Classification-Algorithm-Comparison
This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and classifying social network ads data based on user demographics like age and estimated salary. The project utilizes various classification algorithms to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their demographic information. Various classification algorithms are compared and analysed based on their performance. The algorithms used are:

Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
Naive Baye's
Passive Aggressive Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors
